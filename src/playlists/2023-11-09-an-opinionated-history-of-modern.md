Hypothesis: while it is usually impossible to pick a precise genesis of any cultural movement, for the purposes of this exercise, R.E.M.'s "Radio Free Europe" gave birth to "modern rock," and Radiohead's "Paranoid Android" killed it. I slid in some obvious precursors to R.E.M. and covered the dénouement and fallout from _OK Computer_ as well.

This one has been kicking around my head for a while, inspired by tapes teenage me made off of Philly's own [WDRE](https://xpn.org/2017/02/07/dare-different-importance-phillys-wdre-20-years-later/) (RIP), late nights staying up for [120 Minutes](https://120minutes.org) (their [1993 year end best of episode](https://120minutes.org/1993/#122693) was a foundational text), countless mixtapes, mix CDs and playlists made and received over the years, and [Matthew Perpetua's](http://www.fluxblog.org/about/) exhaustive work cataloging and curating the last 40+ years of music (here's [a thread of his playlists](https://twitter.com/perpetua/status/1605574377096953856) I referred to heavily while creating this playlist.)
