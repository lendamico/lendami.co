Inspired by [this tweet from Matthew Perpetua](https://x.com/perpetua/status/1810806620470817155), pointing out that R.E.M.'s 1995 Monster tour featured a veritable who's who of contemporaneous alt music, the first half of the playlist is a grab bag of artist who opened for R.E.M. during that international trek, including Sonic Youth, Radiohead, The Cranberries, Grant Lee Buffalo, PJ Harvey, Blur, Oasis, Sleeper and Belly. The second half is a super-sized representation of R.E.M.'s setlists at the time.

(Yes, I know the shows with PJ Harvey opening were cancelled, and that the Blur and Oasis shows were probably more like co-headlining. Shut up and enjoy the playlist.)
