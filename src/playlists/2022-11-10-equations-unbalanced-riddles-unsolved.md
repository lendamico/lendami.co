Listening to "Pony Express Record" this week, I wondered "where are the rest of the bands that did **this**?" Admittedly, they're hard to find, but that led me to creating this playlist: Where post-hardcore, math and feelings meet. A mix of scenes, but admittedly DC-heavy, light on "emo for emo's sake" if it doesn't have mathy undertones.
