I didn’t even realize it at the time, but yesterday I bought a copy of “(What’s The Story) Morning Glory?” at a [vinyl shop](https://sisterray.co.uk/) on the street where [the album’s cover photo](https://www.timeout.com/london/music/soho-oasis-whats-the-story-morning-glory-berwick-street-20-years-on) was taken.
