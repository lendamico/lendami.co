title: I don't dream of labor
tags: ['design']

I don't dream of labor, but if I did, working for [18F](https://18f.org) would have been a dream job. Their work raised the bar for what citizens can and should expect from government technology. They saved taxpayers billions of dollars. And, thanks to their [open-first philosophy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md), their contributions to the disciplines of human-centered design and software development are immeasurable.

The concept of "running government like a business" is deeply flawed, because it misunderstands the purpose of both. But, in terms of efficiency, excellence, impact, and value, it would be hard to beat the 18F model. 

I hope those impacted quickly find new opportunities, and I invite you to join me in demanding that that our elected officials immediately address the outrageous circumstances that led to 18F's closure. We *all* deserve better.
