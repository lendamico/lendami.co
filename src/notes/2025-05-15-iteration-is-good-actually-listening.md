Iteration is good, actually.
Listening to your customers is good, actually.
Fixing a mistake quickly is good, actually.

Too many brands and products remain stagnant, ignore their users in favor of the whims of their leadership, and let pride and the sunk cost fallacy prevent them from doing the obviously correct thing. 

Bravo, HBO Max.
