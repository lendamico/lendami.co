> Media corporations are not our friends. They don&#8217;t care about writers, they don&#8217;t care about audiences, and they don&#8217;t care about subject matter. Working for them is like surfing – you can ride a wave for a while but it will eventually crash. Major media corporations like Condé Nast and the <em>New York Times</em> are attractive to writers because they seem like firm institutions that are less likely to collapse, but that&#8217;s just an illusion.
